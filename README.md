Encryption: Using strong algorithms like RSA. You can use libraries like OpenSSL for this purpose.

Key Management: Store encryption keys securely. You may encrypt the key itself with a master password or use hardware-based key storage solutions for added security.

Access Control: Implement mechanisms to control access to files, such as user authentication and authorization.

Secure File I/O: Ensure that file I/O operations are performed securely to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or directory traversal attacks.

Secure Communication: If the files are accessed remotely, use secure communication protocols like HTTPS to protect data in transit.
